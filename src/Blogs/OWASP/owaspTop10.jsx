      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Detailed Breakdown of OWASP Top 10</h2>
        
        <div className="mb-4">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700">A1: Broken Access Control</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Broken Access Control occurs when restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are not properly enforced. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functions. Examples include bypassing access controls by modifying the URL or using default passwords.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            <strong>How to Prevent Broken Access Control:</strong> Preventing broken access control requires proper implementation of role-based access control (RBAC) and ensuring that access controls are thoroughly tested. Regular audits and the principle of least privilege should be applied.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="mb-4">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700">A2: Cryptographic Failures</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Cryptography is essential for protecting sensitive data, but if implemented incorrectly, it can lead to significant vulnerabilities. Cryptographic failures occur when weak encryption methods are used or when encryption is not used where it should be.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            <strong>Common Vulnerabilities in Cryptography:</strong> Some common cryptographic vulnerabilities include using outdated encryption algorithms, improper key management, and failing to encrypt sensitive data in transit or at rest.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-4">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700">A3: Injection</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Injection attacks occur when an attacker sends untrusted data to an interpreter, causing it to execute unintended commands. SQL injection is one of the most common forms of this attack.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            <strong>Types of Injection Attacks:</strong> There are several types of injection attacks, including SQL injection, Command injection, and LDAP injection. Each of these exploits the way data is processed by the application.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            <strong>Preventing Injection Attacks:</strong> To prevent injection attacks, developers should use parameterized queries, avoid using dynamic SQL, and validate all user inputs. Input sanitization and escaping special characters are also crucial.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="mb-4">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700">A4: Insecure Design</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Insecure design refers to the absence of security controls in the design of an application. This can include poor architectural choices, lack of encryption, or inadequate validation mechanisms.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            <strong>Examples of Insecure Design in Web Applications:</strong> Common examples of insecure design include insufficient authentication mechanisms, lack of security logging, and failure to implement input validation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-4">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700">A5: Security Misconfiguration</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Security misconfiguration happens when security settings are not defined, implemented, or maintained correctly. This can lead to vulnerabilities such as exposing unnecessary services, default accounts, or incomplete configurations.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            <strong>How to Avoid Misconfiguration:</strong> Avoiding security misconfiguration requires regular security audits, using automated tools to check configurations, and keeping software up-to-date. Properly configuring and hardening all components is key.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-4">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700">A6: Vulnerable and Outdated Components</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Using outdated or vulnerable components, such as libraries and frameworks, exposes an application to known vulnerabilities. Attackers often exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            <strong>Keeping Components Up-to-Date:</strong> Regularly updating all components and using tools like dependency checkers can help mitigate the risks associated with vulnerable and outdated components. It's essential to stay informed about the latest security patches and updates.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-4">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700">A7: Identification and Authentication Failures</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. Weak authentication mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access and compromise sensitive information.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            <strong>Common Authentication Failures:</strong> Common failures include using weak passwords, not implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA), and failing to properly manage session tokens. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-4">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700">A8: Software and Data Integrity Failures</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Software and data integrity failures occur when an application or its data is compromised due to untrusted code or unvalidated data. This can happen during software updates, code deployments, or data transfers.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            <strong>Ensuring Integrity in Software Development:</strong> Ensuring software and data integrity involves implementing checksums, using digital signatures, and employing secure coding practices. Continuous monitoring and validation are essential to maintain integrity.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-4">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700">A9: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Logging and monitoring are critical for detecting and responding to security incidents. Failure to log important events or monitor the application can leave an organization blind to ongoing attacks.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            <strong>Best Practices for Logging and Monitoring:</strong> Best practices include logging all critical events, ensuring logs are protected from tampering, and regularly reviewing logs for suspicious activity. Implementing a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system can enhance monitoring.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-4">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700">A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            SSRF occurs when an attacker can manipulate a server to make requests to unintended locations. This can lead to the exposure of internal systems or allow the attacker to bypass firewalls.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            <strong>Preventing SSRF Attacks:</strong> To prevent SSRF attacks, developers should validate and sanitize all incoming requests, restrict server access to internal systems, and use firewall rules to limit outgoing traffic.
